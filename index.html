            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included"
            language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based,
            object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once,
            run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
            Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that
            can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
            The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification)
            that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
            popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications,
            with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

            <h1>C</h1>
            <p>C is a general-purpose computer programming language.
               It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie,
                and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect
                the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems,
                device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[6][dubious – discuss] for application software.
                C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest
                microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a
            programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022,
            98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
            often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have
            a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
